# About the project

We present to your attention the documentation of **ALT Mobile**.

This is an Open Source project hosted on GitHub. Such placement allows everyone to supplement the pages of the "Documentation", make forks, clone the project, saving and changing it to their liking.

## The principle of operation

**ALT Mobile Wiki** runs on VitePress technology. These are static text files with the md extension, with some "beautifying" additions from VitePress. Unlike the "dry" markup language md, we get the opportunity to place emoticons, highlight and focus on important code elements, add beautiful colored Warning blocks and many more delicious and bright things.

The documentation portal is linked to our GitHub repository. Offer your edits in the form of a Pull Request and after approval they will instantly appear on the site.

## Authors and participants of the project

The project **ALT Mobile Wiki** belongs to the Russian-speaking community **ALT Linux Team**, is developed and maintained on a voluntary basis. Each of the community members is an equal co-owner of the project and makes their own contribution.
